# Learning Haskell Programming [Video]
This is the code repository for [Learning Haskell Programming [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-application-functional-haskell-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787285088), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Haskell is a powerful and well-designed functional programming language designed to work with complex data. Its emphasis on "purity" makes it easier to create rock-solid applications which stay maintainable and error-free even as they grow in scale.
This video would begin with the fundamentals and building blocks of Haskell programming language with special emphasis on functional programming. It will be covering how Haskell variables, syntax work alongwith Haskell datatypes and functions. 
You will learn how to solve programming problems while creating an application with hands-on experience. You will then move on to learning writing expressions and high-order functions. 
At the end of the video, you will be able to build a complete application with Haskell alongwith learning the important functionalities.
